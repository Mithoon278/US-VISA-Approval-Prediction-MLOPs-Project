# US-VISA-Approval-Prediction-MLOPs-Project

The process of applying for a US visa is often lengthy, with numerous applications being rejected due to unmet criteria. To streamline this process and provide applicants with actionable insights, we have developed a machine learning-powered system that predicts the likelihood of visa approval. By analyzing the information provided by applicants, our solution offers a data-driven way to identify potential issues, enabling applicants to take corrective actions before submission.
