# US-VISA-Approval-Prediction-MLOPs-Project

The process of applying for a US visa is often lengthy, with numerous applications being rejected due to unmet criteria. To streamline this process and provide applicants with actionable insights, we have developed a machine learning-powered system that predicts the likelihood of visa approval. By analyzing the information provided by applicants, our solution offers a data-driven way to identify potential issues, enabling applicants to take corrective actions before submission.

## Project Overview:

This project aims to predict the outcome of US visa applications by developing a machine learning model. This model processes a series of input data to determine the likelihood of visa approval. We source our data from a comprehensive dataset available on Kaggle, which can be found at the following link: [EasyVisa Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moro23/easyvisa-dataset).

To refine our data and enhance the model's accuracy, we undertake Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. These critical steps are documented in our project notebooks, accessible via the following links:

* EDA Process: [EDA Notebook](https://github.com/Mithoon278/US-VISA-Approval-Prediction-MLOPs-Project/blob/main/notebook/1_EDA_US_visa.ipynb)
* Feature Engineering and Model Training: [Feature Engineering Notebook](https://github.com/Mithoon278/US-VISA-Approval-Prediction-MLOPs-Project/blob/main/notebook/2_Feature_Engineering_and_Model_Training.ipynb)

Our approach is not limited to a single machine learning algorithm; instead, we explore a variety of classification algorithms including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors Classifier, XGBClassifier, and CatBoost Classifier. To optimize performance, we apply hyperparameter tuning to these models and select the most effective one based on predictive accuracy.

The project is structured in a modular code format, facilitating maintainability and scalability. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are implemented via GitHub Actions, ensuring automated testing and deployment. The final system is hosted on AWS, leveraging services such as S3 buckets, Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and EC2 instances to provide a robust and scalable solution.
